# Gutter Shadow
## An Atom Package - [Atom.io](https://atom.io/packages/gutter-shadow) : [Github](https://github.com/dsandstrom/atom-gutter-shadow) : [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dsandstrom/atom-gutter-shadow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dsandstrom/atom-gutter-shadow)
Add a shadow under the gutter when you are scrolled away from it.  This makes it easier to tell when you aren't scrolled all the way to the left.

### Configuration
<dl>   <dt>Always On</dt>   <dd>The shadow is always visible, even when scrolled all the way to the left.</dd>

### Todo
I would like to make the shadow's color, opacity, and size configurable options.  Also, something settable in your UI theme.

### Notes
In beta.  Issues are welcome.  I'll accept pull requests after I get a few more things completed.
